    <p><b>As in the movie The Lion King, a software project will follow its own circle of life, from project initiation, through project execution, and finally to project termination and closeout. Along its circle of life, a project requires documentation. Sunset documentation supports the requirements and activities associated with a projectâ€™s eventual termination and closeout. It also supports the requirements and activities associated with any subsequent reconstitution of the project. After a project ends and its support staff disperses, sunset documentation may represent the only public record for the project and provide the only keys to reactivate it.</b></p>
